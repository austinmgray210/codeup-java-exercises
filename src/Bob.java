/**
 * Method courtesy of Bryce Payne, of the Fortuna class.
 * Create a class named Bob with a main method for the following exercise.
 *
 * Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
 *
 * Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question. (the input ends with a question mark)
 * He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him. (the input ends with an exclamation mark)
 * He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.
 * (empty input)
 *
 * He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
 *
 * Write the Java code necessary so that a user of your command line application can
 * have a conversation with Bob.
